# Installation and Running Instructions
I implemented a postgres database with docker-compose, just run `docker-compose up` to start it in port 5432.
Remember: you have to have Docker running on background (Docker-Desktop for windows and mac).
You can connect to it (it's called 'docker') with user 'docker' and password 'docker' through localhost.
